# Question ledger

Every practice question that has been asked, so new ones don't repeat old ones.
**Check this file before authoring any new question.** Add a row for each new
question and give it the next free `Q` id.

## What counts as a duplicate

A new question is a **duplicate** if it targets the same SQL concept against the
same entity and produces the same shape of answer. Changing only a constant is a
duplicate, not a new question:

- top 2 per category -> top 3 per category
- average price above $75 -> above $100
- orders in March -> orders in April

A new question is an acceptable **variation** if it changes at least one of:

- **the entity** - top products by revenue -> top *customers* by revenue
- **the mechanism** - correlated subquery -> window function
- **the combination** - joins two concepts that have not been combined before

Similar questions are fine and useful. Re-asks are not.

## Live set

Thirty questions on the repair-depot schema, weighted hard toward
**grain**: half of them punish joining two one-to-many children of the same
parent in a single query block, which was the mistake behind every wrong answer
in the 2026-08-26 session. `Concept` maps to the numbered sections of
`sql-concepts-review.html`. Generated from `exercises.py` - `check_questions.py`
verifies the two agree.

## History

- **Q001-Q041** the original breadth-first set (2026-08-24). Retired same day.
- **Q042-Q071** first pass against `sql-concepts-review.html`, on the ordering and
  payments tables. Retired when the schema gained the fulfilment side.
- **Q072-Q101** second pass against the review, on warehouses, inventory,
  shipments and returns. Retired when the schema moved to the repair depot.
- **Q102-Q131** current set, on the repair-depot schema (work orders, parts,
  labour, inspections). Fifteen of the thirty drill grain, because that is what
  the 2026-08-26 session showed was actually costing answers -- in five
  distinct disguises: joining two children at once, a bare column under
  `GROUP BY`, a missing aggregate, re-joining a base table after a CTE had
  collapsed it, and an inverted ratio.
  C8 (alias scope) still has no question: SQLite accepts a SELECT alias even in
  `WHERE`, so the engine cannot enforce the rule. It is covered as prose in
  PRACTICE.md instead.
